# Testing-Website-Accessibilites
In this self thought lesson I will be building application for testing website Accessibilities through Traversy media youtube channel.
I haven't worked on any project like creating application for testing website accessibilities for identying errors and make any neccessary adjustment to the application.
I think it will be quite chanlenging and fun
Time for take is done let's crack on with it.
I will try as much as I can to document every step to the juorney of no none.
Wish me luck
